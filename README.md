- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently not working on anything public, hopefully soon!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) when I can make the time.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any of the projects you see below!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have no socials, there's no good way to do so.
- âš¡ Fun facts:
- - Once upon a time (a long time) I was the creator of one of the biggest League of Legends apps, Championify, with over 250,000 users in 41 languages, and got me in to the first Riot Games community hackathon!
- - My Discord bot Gravebot if memory serves hit 70,000 users before a buddy and I called it quits. Fun times! It's
    partially what has inspired my current chat app [Oatmeal](https://github.com/dustinblackman/oatmeal).
